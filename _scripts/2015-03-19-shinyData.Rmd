title: shinyData - GUI for data analysis and reporting
tags: R BI shiny
---

Some people find very hard to start using R because it has no GUI.  
There exists [some](http://www.rcommander.com/) GUIs which offers some of the functionality of R.  
In this post I would like to focus on one such GUI, a very new shiny application called [shinyData](https://github.com/yindeng/shinyData).  
I hope the app will make it easier for some to get into R environment.  
Also it can reduce development time of analysis and reports for existing R users.  

```{r prepare_csv, echo=FALSE, results='hide', eval=FALSE}
library(dwtools)
X <- dw.populate(scenario="star")
DT <- joinbyv(X$SALES, list(X$GEOGRAPHY, X$TIME, X$CURRENCY), col.subset = list(c("geog_division_name","geog_region_name"),c("time_month_code","time_month_name","time_year_code"),NULL))
DT
DT <- DT[,c("cust_code","prod_code","geog_code","time_code") := NULL # drop some fk
   ][, lapply(.SD,sum), by = c(names(DT)[seq_len(length(DT)-2L)]) # aggr by columns except last two of them (amount, value)
     ][, `:=`(time_date = as.Date(paste(time_year_code,time_month_code,"01",sep="-")))][]
write.table(DT,"input.csv",sep=",",row.names=FALSE)
```

## shinyData

The shiny app is well described in [this](https://shinydata.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/intro/) post already. In my post I will make a live test of it on my sales data.  
App is hosted on slow shinyapps.io so I would recommend to run it locally. It requires/recommends particular version of dependencies, I will use new library:  

```{r install_shiny_data, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
lib <- paste(getwd(),"shinyData_lib",sep="/")
dir.create(lib)
with_lib(lib,{
  install_github("trestletech/shinyTree@522f8a7e28565bec0f634faf5aa1e75da247de44")
  install_github("trestletech/shinyAce@a2268d545e0ea30eb44c9dca517aec1165b06a51")
  install_github("ebailey78/shinyBS", ref = "shinyBS3")
  install_github("AnalytixWare/ShinySky@15c29bec4e7c5e694625e571656515a8ace7f376")
  install_github("yindeng/shinyData@v0.1.1")
  library("shinyData")
  shinyData()
})
```

## shinyData live

Once you've launched app you can see a *projects* page. You can choose some examples, I will skip to *data* tab as I prefer to load own data from csv file. Yet very useful feature is ability to save project and load it later. I highly recommend to use that feature as it costs nothing and may save your work.  

### Data

I have csv of randomly populated sales data dimensioned by currency, geography and time. Once I've loaded data I see its preview. App will automatically recognize measures in my dataset.

### Visualize

The most interesting part is to produce some information from the data.  
First I need to choose the data, then I can start to do mapping between columns from dataset to the elements on plot, particularly the [ggplot2](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2).  
You can make multiple sheets of visualization, I will create two.  
  
  
#### I've put time on X axis and value on Y axis, values are grouped into division name using colors and organized into the panels by region and currency type

#### Results can looks like

![by_region_currency_type](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3627377/6740793/c5c58de4-ce7a-11e4-8d35-dad346a73ce5.png)

#### One more plot with year on X axis grouped into division names, value on Y axis

### Presentation

I have my two sheets of visualizations so I can try to build some report based on them.  
Presentation tab combines a plaintext (markdown) editor and gives ability to nest elements from R, in this case also the products of *visualization*.  
This is simply what *rmarkdown* package do, yet you don't need to know rmarkdown. Write the text as in the notepad and add your visualization sheets by click on *Insert Sheet* element on the left sidebar.  

Below is the content of the report that I'm going to produce.  
Important to note: *rmarkdown* gives ability to render your documents into various format: html, pdf, word, markdown, etc.

## Summary

shinyData is a well built shinyApp which can make the life easier for some R user, and for new ones limit the learning curve to minimum still giving possibility to produce some nice reports.  
Personally I prefer to work on fully reproducible scripts, so for me shinyData is more a presentation of capabilities which R, shiny and open source community can bring.
